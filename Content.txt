Balasubramanian of class 11, studying in Sri Jayanta Saraswati Swamigal Golden and now I am here to present the project named Driver Drowsiness Detecting System. 
One of the most important qualities of a good driver is that he should be skilled enough to handle any situation on the road. 
At times, due to long travel, he feels drowsy and sleepy. 
This leads to a lot of accidents on the highway. 
Our project helps to provide a solution to this problem. 
The objective of this project is to ensure safety while driving. 
we detecting
 
the
 
eye's
 
aspect
 
ratio
 
of
 
the
 
driver
 
to
 
estimate
 
the
 
driver
 
status.
 
Now
 
Satyashkumar
 
will
 
explain
 
about
 
this
 
flow
 
chart.
 
When
 
the
 
engine
 
is
 
turned
 
on,
 
the
 
camera
 
starts
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
video.
 
It
 
draws
 
a
 
rectangle
 
around
 
the
 
face
 
using
 
face
 
detector
 
and
 
predictor
 
technique.
 
It
 
calculates
 
the
 
aspect

ratio
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
eye
 
using
 
Euclidean
 
distance.
 
If
 
the
 
eye
 
aspect
 
ratio
 
is
 
less
 
than
 
the
 
threshold,
 
then
 
it
 
plays
 
an
 
alarm
 
to
 
alert
 
others
 
and
 
also
 
display
 
the
 
driver
 
is
 
drowsy,
 
then
 
it
 
ends
 
the
 
program.
 
Now
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
this
 
project.
 
Now
 
the
 
driver
 
is
 
wide

awake.
 
This
 
is
 
projected
 
in
 
the
 
image.
 
Now
 
his
 
eyes
 
droop.
 
Immediately
 
the
 
computer
 
recognizes
 
it
 
and
 
sends
 
an
 
alarm.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
the
 
driver
 
to
 
wake
 
up.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
improvised
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
inbuilt
 
system
 
in
 
the
 
vehicle
 
which
 
can
 
control
 
and
 
stop
 
the
 
vehicle
 
when
 
required.
 
We
 
believe

this
 
project
 
will
 
help
 
to
 
avoid
 
accidents
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
vehicle
 
drivers
 
falling
 
asleep.
 
Hope
 
you
 
like
 
this
 
project.
 
Thank
 
you.
